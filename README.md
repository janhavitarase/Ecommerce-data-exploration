# Ecommerce data exploration using SQL

Overview:
In this project, I performed a comprehensive SQL-based analysis of TheLook's e-commerce data, a clothing retailer developed by the Google Looker team. The dataset, hosted on Google BigQuery, includes transactional records from August 2019 to September 2024.
The goal was to explore customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends by working with a subset of the available data, focusing on four key tables: Order_items, Orders, Products, and Users. This analysis provides actionable insights for product evaluation, customer segmentation, and business growth strategies.

Tool used : BigQuery
